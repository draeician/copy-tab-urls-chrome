Can I install this extension in librewolf?
---
There isn't an xpi file in teh repo though, so how do we install it?
---
Create a bash file to create the xpi file.
---
xpi file appears to be corrupted, according to librewolf's installation.
---
I still get this error in the screen shot.

And now it won't install due to it being corrupted according to librewolf.

According to librewolf.

It worked.. okay clean up the xpi files that aren't working, remove the build scripts that aren't needed, and update the documentation/instructions for the firefox process. Fyi.. still works in chrome.
